🚩 Problem Statement (PS ID 2)

The Student Financial Crisis

Students struggle to interpret financial data and spending patterns due to the absence of intelligent, personalized financial analysis and guidance.

The Reality

Students need more than static transaction summaries — they need contextual, forward-looking financial advice.

The Gap

Most existing banking apps function as digital passbooks. They show what happened, but fail to explain why it matters or how to improve future financial decisions.

⸻

🎯 Key Challenges Addressed

Cognitive Overload

Fragmented and technical financial data leads to confusion and inaction among students.

Impulse Spending

Students lack visualization of how small, daily expenses compound into major financial consequences over time.

The “Scary” Factor

Traditional finance tools feel rigid and intimidating. Students need a peer-like financial coach, not spreadsheets.

⸻

💡 Our Solution — MoneyPal AI

MoneyPal AI acts as an intelligent personal finance coach that combines conversational AI, behavioral pattern analysis, and real-time feedback to guide students toward better financial decisions.

🔹 Conversational Intelligence

Uses large language models (Gemini 2.0) to interpret natural-language financial queries and convert them into data-driven budget simulations.

🔹 Automated Budgeting

Applies spending pattern analysis and user profiling to generate adaptive budgets, savings plans, and goal-oriented financial recommendations.

✨ The “Magic Moment” — Unique Value Proposition

MoneyPal goes beyond alerts and charts by creating a direct link between conversation and action.

Dynamic Goal Creation

A simple confirmation like “Yes” to a purchase goal (e.g., buying a guitar) instantly creates a live progress tracker on the dashboard.

Proactive Intervention

The AI proactively warns users when specific spending categories threaten critical budgets (e.g., social spending affecting textbook funds).

Contextual Awareness

Long-term strategies such as SIPs or RDs are visualized over years, making complex financial concepts easy to understand.
